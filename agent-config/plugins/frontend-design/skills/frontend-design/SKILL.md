# Frontend Design Skill

This skill guides the creation of production-grade web interfaces that prioritize distinctive aesthetics over generic AI-generated designs.

## Core Purpose

The skill helps developers build components, pages, or applications with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices, specifically avoiding generic AI-generated designs.

## Key Design Principles

### Strategic Approach

Before coding, establish a bold aesthetic direction by considering:
- Purpose and tone
- Constraints and differentiation
- The key principle: intentionality, not intensity

Both maximalist and minimalist approaches work when executed with clarity.

### Visual Excellence

Prioritize:
- **Distinctive Typography** - Use thoughtful font choices beyond generic options
- **Cohesive Color Systems** - Implement CSS variables for consistent theming
- **Strategic Animation** - Focus on high-impact moments rather than decorative effects
- **Unexpected Spatial Composition** - Embrace asymmetry and overlap
- **Atmospheric Details** - Add backgrounds and textural elements with intention

## What to Avoid

The skill explicitly warns against these common pitfalls:
- Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
- Clichéd color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds)
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
- Cookie-cutter design approaches

## Implementation Philosophy

Match code complexity to aesthetic vision:
- Maximalist designs require elaborate animations
- Refined designs demand precision in spacing and typography
- Commit fully to a distinctive vision rather than defaulting to safe, conventional choices

The overall message: intentionality and cohesion create production-grade interfaces that stand out.
